# lineguide

This repository houses code for a graphical user interface that is used to control a robot transfer unit. The interface is created using the PyQt5 Python library. The main application incorporates networking and plotting scripts. [network.py](https://github.com/samerwh/lineguide/blob/main/network.py) enables TCP communaction with the software running on the hardware board (Raspberry Pi 4 B). [plot.py](https://github.com/samerwh/lineguide/blob/main/plot.py) plots the track position with matplotlib.
